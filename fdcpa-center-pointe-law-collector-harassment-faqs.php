                                    Legally, yes we can. When you hire an attorney to represent you, Debt collectors must stop contacting you by phone or mail, and instead contact your attorney regarding your case. Unfortunately, many Debt collectors do not respect the consumer protection laws–and may continue to harass you by telephone, mail, or cell phone even after you’ve retained an attorney. Luckily, Creditor Law Group can assist you in filing a lawsuit against the Debt collectors if this happens. Creditor Law Group is licensed and admitted to file lawsuits in federal court, and is well-versed in the abuses detailed in the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Actand the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act. If your rights as a consumer are being violated, Creditor Law Group will represent you in your lawsuit against the Debt collector that continues to harass you or otherwise violates the law. Don’t accept harassment as part of your day-to-day life! Contact a skilled consumer lawyer regarding your situation.

                                    You have most likely heard of the collection law called the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, commonly referred to in our business as the FDCPA. This federal collection law (act) protects consumers from bill collector harassment, abuse and mistreatment. If you are being harassed by a Debt collector or bill collector, you have the right to retain an attorney and file a lawsuit against the Debt collector that is harassing you.</br>
How do I know if I am being harassed or abuse? What are the Debt collectors allowed to do, and what is against the rules?</br>
You can find a copy of the entire Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by clicking here: FDCPA</br>
The FDCPA lists pages and pages of violations. Here are some of the more common violations that we hear about from our clients:</br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>debt collectors calling before 8 AM or after 9 PM</li>
                                        <li>bill collectors calling a person’s workplace after being told this not permitted</li>
                                        <li>debt collectors using obscene language</li>
                                        <li>debt collectors continuing to contact you after being told that you are represented by an attorney</li>
                                        <li>not telling you that they are debt collectors at the beginning of the telephone call</li>
                                        <li>threatening you with arrest or imprisonment</li>
                                        <li>threatening to tell friends/neighbors/family members about your debt problems</li>
                                        Again, there are many more violations listed in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Our staff will review a checklist with you and answer any questions regarding your harassment case during your free consultation.

                                        <li>You will be given a “hotline” telephone number to call 24 hours a day to report new types of harassment and abuse, and find out what to do.</li>

                                    Believe it or not, most of our clients who are being abused or harassed by bill collectors never set foot in the courtroom. Often, when the executives at a Creditor Law Group collection company are made aware by Creditor Law Group that one or more of their staff members has been harassing and abusing a consumer, and that the consumer has the documentation to prove their claim, the Debt collector will settle the case out of court. However, there is a chance that your case will go to trial before a jury, with Creditor Law Group by your side in the courtroom, presenting your case.
