                <h3>GARNISHMENT REVERSAL AND RELIEF</h3>

                <p><b>Nightmare Scenario #1:</b> You check your bank balance on payday. Instead of the hundreds or
                    thousands of dollars you expect, you find a ZERO BALANCE.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p><b>Nightmare Scenario #2:</b> You open the envelope containing your paycheck. Instead of the expected
                    amount, you find that you have been paid 25% less than your typical wage.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Are you a victim of fraud? Have criminals hacked your bank account? Perhaps this is a case of
                    identity theft?</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>No–you are a victim of legal garnishment, and this can result in a zero bank balance.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>In addition to removing money from your bank account without your knowledge, legal garnishment can
                    also result in up to a 25% reduction in your paycheck–every paycheck–until the judgment is
                    satisfied.</p>

                <p>When clients arrive in my office asking if a legal garnishment can be “undone”, I answer with a
                    “maybe”, and ask a series of specific questions to determine the likelihood. Here are some examples
                    of situations that might result in a full or partial reduction/reversal of garnishment:</p>

                <br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>The funds being garnished are Social Security, Disability or Veterans’ benefits</li>
                    <li>The funds being garnished are Unemployment or Workers’ compensation</li>
                    <li>The funds being garnished are wages earned by the “head of household”</li>
                    <li>The judgment that resulted in the garnishment can be vacated</li>
                    <li>The amount of the garnishment can be reduced by negotiation</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>These are only a few examples of situations that could result in the reversal of legal garnishment in
                    your home state. Many of these examples are “claims of exemption.” A consumer must file for a claim
                    of exemption within 20 days of the notification of garnishment. The filing will result in a hearing
                    that will stop the garnishment if the court rules that the consumer does qualify for the claim of
                    exemption. If the court rules in the consumer’s favor, money previously seized will be returned.</p>

                <br><br>

                <p>The final example, voiding or vacating the original default judgment, is a bit more involved, and
                    refers to the original judgment obtained by the Debt collector. When clients meet with me about
                    stopping or reversing a legal garnishment, in addition to exploring possible claims of exemption, I
                    also explore the possibility that the original judgment was obtained improperly, and could be
                    vacated with a motion for relief. In this case, not only would the garnishment end and the client’s
                    money be returned, but the judgment would be dismissed, and the consumer would have an opportunity
                    to get out of the debt entirely. A local consumer attorney would be able to discuss and review your
                    original default judgment for improper procedure (i.e. sewer service, improper notice, a Fair Debt
                    Collection Practices Act violation, etc).</p>

                <br><br>

                <h3>PLEASE KEEP THESE TWO THINGS IN MIND:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>1. Even if you qualify for a claim of exemption, or other relief, your wages will continue to be
                    garnished and placed in a escrow account while you wait for the hearing. (*Note – calling the
                    judge’s assistant and asking for a hearing will speed up the process, and may give you a more
                    convenient date).</p>
                <br><br>

                <p>2. After the hearing, you must wait for the plaintiff (the Debt collector) to complete the steps
                    required to return your money to you. (Or, if you go to the hearing prepared with a proposed order
                    you can greatly speed up the process).</p>
                <br><br>

                <p>A local attorney experienced in stopping or reversing garnishment should be able to assist you every
                    step of the way in your quest to stop or dissolve a legal garnishment, by:</p>

                    <br><br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>reviewing your case for possible exemptions or other relief</li>
                        <li>representing you at the hearing</li>
                        <li>speeding the process of your return of funds, if your case is successful</li>
                        <li>negotiating a better deal, if you don’t have exemptions</li>
                    </ul>
