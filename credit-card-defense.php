                <h3>CREDIT CARD DEFENSE</h3>

                <p>If you are being sued by a Debt collector, FIGHT BACK and you may save thousands. A money judgment is
                    likely to be followed by a garnishment of your wages (up to 25%.)</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Has a lawsuit been filed against you by a Debt collector?</li>
                    <li>Have you been served with a summons?</li>
                    <li>Are you confused by the legal process?</li>
                    <li>Are you nervous about going to court?</li>
                    <li>Are you unable to take time off from work to attend court?</li>
                    <li>Are you afraid that something bad might happen to your family financially?</li>
                    <li>Do you feel like this isn’t fair?</li>
                    <li>Do you wish this problem would just go away?</li>
                </ul>

                <br><br>
                If you answered “YES!” to one or more of these questions, you are not alone. Don’t worry–your situation
                is not as bad as you think. Often, debt collection agencies do not have enough proof to win in court, if
                you fight back.
